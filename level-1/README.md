## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### ⚠️ Issue: "fatal: not a git repository"
**Solution**: Make sure you're in a directory that has been initialized with `git init`

### ⚠️ Issue: "Please tell me who you are"
**Solution**: Configure your Git user name and email:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### ⚠️ Issue: Can't switch branches due to uncommitted changes
**Solution**: Either commit your changes or stash them:
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Save changes"
# OR
git stash
```
