# Week 1: Repository Setup & Basic Commands

## Exercise 1: Initialize a New Git Repository (`git init`)

### What it does:
Creates a new Git repository in the current directory, initializing the `.git` folder that tracks all changes.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. Open terminal and navigate to a new directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-first-repo
   cd my-first-repo
   ```

2. Initialize the Git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. Verify the repository was created:
   ```bash
   ls -la
   ```
   You should see a `.git` folder.

### Expected output:
```
Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/my-first-repo/.git/
```

### Practice task:
- Create a new directory called `practice-repo`
- Initialize it as a Git repository
- Check that the `.git` folder exists

---

## Exercise 2: Clone an Existing Repository (`git clone`)

### What it does:
Downloads a copy of an existing repository from a remote source (like GitHub) to your local machine.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. Find a repository URL (e.g., from GitHub)
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```

3. Navigate into the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```

### Expected output:
```
Cloning into 'repository-name'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 100, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (100/100), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (80/80), done.
Receiving objects: 100% (100/100), done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (50/50), done.
```

### Practice task:
- Clone this repository: `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World`
- Explore the files in the cloned repository

---

## Exercise 3: Check Repository Status (`git status`)

### What it does:
Shows the current state of your working directory and staging area, including which files are tracked, modified, or staged.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. In your Git repository, create a new file:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello World" > hello.txt
   ```

2. Check the status:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

3. Add the file to staging:
   ```bash
   git add hello.txt
   ```

4. Check status again:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

### Expected output (before adding):
```
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        hello.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

### Expected output (after adding):
```
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   hello.txt
```

### Practice task:
- Create multiple files with different content
- Use `git status` to see which files are untracked
- Add some files and check status again

---

## Exercise 4: Add Files to Staging Area (`git add`)

### What it does:
Moves files from the working directory to the staging area, preparing them for the next commit.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. Create multiple files:
   ```bash
   echo "File 1 content" > file1.txt
   echo "File 2 content" > file2.txt
   echo "File 3 content" > file3.txt
   ```

2. Add specific files:
   ```bash
   git add file1.txt file2.txt
   ```

3. Add all files at once:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. Add files by pattern:
   ```bash
   git add *.txt
   ```

### Useful variations:
```bash
git add <filename>          # Add specific file
git add .                   # Add all files in current directory
git add *.txt              # Add all .txt files
git add -A                 # Add all changes (including deletions)
git add -p                 # Interactive add (choose changes)
```

### Practice task:
- Create 5 different files with various extensions (.txt, .md, .js)
- Add files individually, then in groups
- Use `git status` to verify what's staged

---

## Exercise 5: Commit Changes (`git commit`)

### What it does:
Creates a snapshot of the staged changes with a descriptive message, permanently recording the changes in Git history.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. Stage your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. Commit with a message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Add hello world files"
   ```

3. Commit without staging (for tracked files):
   ```bash
   git commit -am "Update existing files"
   ```

### Best practices for commit messages:
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Be descriptive and specific
- Use imperative mood

### Examples of good commit messages:
```
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve login page crash
docs: update README with installation steps
style: format code according to style guide
```

### Practice task:
- Make several commits with different types of changes
- Practice writing good commit messages
- Try both `git commit -m` and `git commit -am`

---

## Exercise 6: View Commit History (`git log`)

### What it does:
Displays the commit history, showing when changes were made, by whom, and what was changed.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. View basic commit history:
   ```bash
   git log
   ```

2. View compact history:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

3. View graph of branches:
   ```bash
   git log --graph --oneline --all
   ```

4. View specific number of commits:
   ```bash
   git log -n 5
   ```

### Useful options:
```bash
git log --oneline          # Compact format
git log --graph           # Show branch structure
git log --author="name"   # Filter by author
git log --since="2023-01-01"  # Filter by date
git log -p               # Show changes in each commit
git log --stat           # Show file statistics
```

### Practice task:
- Make several commits with different messages
- Explore different `git log` formats
- Try filtering commits by author or date
