# Week 2: Working with Branches

## Exercise 1: Create a New Branch (`git branch`)

### What it does:
Creates a new branch pointer that points to the current commit, allowing you to work on features without affecting the main codebase.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. First, ensure you have some commits in your repository:
   ```bash
   echo "Main content" > main-file.txt
   git add main-file.txt
   git commit -m "Add main file"
   ```

2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git branch feature-branch
   ```

3. Verify the branch was created:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

### Expected output:
```
* main
  feature-branch
```
The asterisk (*) indicates your current branch.

### Practice task:
- Create 3 different branches with descriptive names
- Use `git branch` to list all branches
- Understand which branch you're currently on

---

## Exercise 2: Switch Between Branches (`git checkout`)

### What it does:
Moves your working directory to a different branch, changing which files you see and can modify.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. Switch to the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   ```

2. Verify you're on the new branch:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

3. Switch back to main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

### Expected output when switching:
```
Switched to branch 'feature-branch'
```

### Important notes:
- Your working directory changes when you switch branches
- Files that exist in one branch but not another will appear/disappear
- Uncommitted changes may prevent switching (Git will warn you)

### Practice task:
- Switch between different branches
- Create files on different branches
- Observe how files change when switching branches

---

## Exercise 3: Create and Switch in One Command (`git checkout -b`)

### What it does:
Combines creating a new branch and switching to it in a single command, which is very common in practice.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. Create and switch to a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b new-feature
   ```

2. Verify you're on the new branch:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

3. Make some changes and commit:
   ```bash
   echo "Feature content" > feature-file.txt
   git add feature-file.txt
   git commit -m "Add feature file"
   ```

### Expected output:
```
Switched to a new branch 'new-feature'
```

### Practice task:
- Create multiple feature branches using `git checkout -b`
- Make commits on each branch
- Switch between branches to see different states

---

## Exercise 4: List All Branches (`git branch -a`)

### What it does:
Shows all branches, including local branches and remote branches that your local repository knows about.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. List local branches:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

2. List all branches (local and remote):
   ```bash
   git branch -a
   ```

3. List remote branches only:
   ```bash
   git branch -r
   ```

### Expected output:
```
* main
  feature-branch
  new-feature
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/feature-branch
```

### Useful options:
```bash
git branch              # List local branches
git branch -a           # List all branches (local + remote)
git branch -r           # List remote branches only
git branch -v           # List with last commit info
git branch --merged     # List branches merged into current
git branch --no-merged  # List branches not merged
```

### Practice task:
- Create several branches
- Use different branch listing options
- Understand the difference between local and remote branches

---

## Exercise 5: Delete Branches (`git branch -d`)

### What it does:
Removes a branch pointer from your local repository. The commits are still there but no longer accessible through that branch name.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. Switch to main branch first:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Delete a branch (safe delete):
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature-branch
   ```

3. Force delete a branch (even if not merged):
   ```bash
   git branch -D feature-branch
   ```

### Expected output (safe delete):
```
Deleted branch feature-branch (was a1b2c3d).
```

### Expected output (if branch not merged):
```
error: The branch 'feature-branch' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D feature-branch'.
```

### Important safety notes:
- `-d` (lowercase) = safe delete (only if merged)
- `-D` (uppercase) = force delete (even if not merged)
- You cannot delete the branch you're currently on
- Deleted branches can be recovered if you know the commit hash

### Practice task:
- Create branches with different states (merged vs unmerged)
- Try safe delete on merged branches
- Try force delete on unmerged branches
- Understand when each type of delete is appropriate

## Exercise 6: Branch Management Workflow

### What it does:
Demonstrates a complete workflow for working with branches in a real project scenario.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. Start on main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b user-login-feature
   ```

3. Make changes on the feature branch:
   ```bash
   echo "User login functionality" > login.js
   git add login.js
   git commit -m "feat: add user login component"
   ```

4. Switch back to main and make changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   echo "Updated main content" >> main-file.txt
   git add main-file.txt
   git commit -m "docs: update main documentation"
   ```

5. Switch back to feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout user-login-feature
   ```

6. Merge main into feature (to get latest changes):
   ```bash
   git merge main
   ```

### Practice task:
- Follow the complete workflow above
- Create multiple feature branches
- Practice switching between branches
- Understand how branches isolate work

---

## Exercise 7: Branch Naming Conventions

### Best practices for branch names:
- Use descriptive names that explain the purpose
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens
- Include the type of work (feature, bugfix, hotfix, etc.)

### Examples of good branch names:
```
feature/user-authentication
bugfix/login-error
hotfix/security-patch
docs/api-documentation
refactor/database-connection
```

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. Create branches following naming conventions:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/user-dashboard
   git checkout -b bugfix/button-styling
   git checkout -b docs/readme-update
   ```

2. List all branches to see the naming pattern:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

### Practice task:
- Create branches using different naming conventions
- Practice switching between them
- Understand why good naming is important
