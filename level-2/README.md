2. **Set up GitHub**: Create a test repository for practice
3. **Follow the exercises**: Complete each exercise in order
4. **Practice with others**: Find a partner to practice collaboration
5. **Use real projects**: Apply what you learn to actual projects

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Practice with real repositories**: Use actual GitHub repositories for practice
- **Collaborate with others**: Find teammates or friends to practice with
- **Handle conflicts**: Don't avoid conflicts - practice resolving them
- **Use different strategies**: Try both merge and rebase approaches
- **Read error messages**: Git provides helpful information when things go wrong

---

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### ⚠️ Issue: "Permission denied" when pushing
**Solution**: Check your SSH keys or use HTTPS with personal access token

### ⚠️ Issue: "Merge conflict" during pull
**Solution**: Resolve conflicts manually or use `git pull --rebase`

### ⚠️ Issue: "Non-fast-forward" error
**Solution**: Use `git pull` first, then push, or use `git push --force` (carefully)

### ⚠️ Issue: "Remote branch not found"
**Solution**: Use `git fetch` to update your local knowledge of remote branches

---

## 🔄 Key Concepts

### 🌐 Remote vs Local
- **Local**: Your working copy on your machine
- **Remote**: Repository hosted on a server (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

### 📤 Push vs Pull vs Fetch
- **Push**: Upload local changes to remote
- **Pull**: Download and merge remote changes
- **Fetch**: Download remote changes without merging

### 🔀 Merge vs Rebase
- **Merge**: Combines branches, preserves history
- **Rebase**: Replays commits on top of another branch
