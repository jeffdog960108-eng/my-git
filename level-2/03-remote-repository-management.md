# Week 3: Remote Repository Management

## Exercise 1: Add Remote Repository (`git remote add`)

### What it does:
Connects your local repository to a remote repository (like GitHub), allowing you to share and collaborate on code.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. First, ensure you have a local repository with some commits:
   ```bash
   git init
   echo "Hello World" > hello.txt
   git add hello.txt
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

2. Add a remote repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```

3. Verify the remote was added:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

### Expected output:
```
origin  https://github.com/username/repository-name.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/username/repository-name.git (push)
```

### Practice task:
- Create a new repository on GitHub
- Add it as a remote to your local repository
- Verify the connection

---

## Exercise 2: Push Changes to Remote (`git push`)

### What it does:
Uploads your local commits to the remote repository, making them available to others.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. Make sure you have commits to push:
   ```bash
   echo "New content" >> hello.txt
   git add hello.txt
   git commit -m "Add new content"
   ```

2. Push to remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Push with upstream tracking (first time):
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Expected output:
```
Enumerating objects: 3, done.
Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 234 bytes | 234.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```

### Important notes:
- `-u` sets up tracking between local and remote branches
- After setting up tracking, you can simply use `git push`
- You need appropriate permissions to push to the repository

### Practice task:
- Push your local commits to GitHub
- Set up branch tracking
- Verify your changes appear on GitHub

---

## Exercise 3: Pull Changes from Remote (`git pull`)

### What it does:
Downloads and integrates changes from the remote repository into your local repository.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. Pull the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Pull with merge strategy:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main --no-ff
   ```

3. Pull and rebase:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase origin main
   ```

### Expected output:
```
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/username/repository-name
 * branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD
   a1b2c3d..e4f5g6h  main     -> origin/main
Updating a1b2c3d..e4f5g6h
Fast-forward
 new-file.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

### Different pull strategies:
```bash
git pull origin main          # Fetch and merge
git pull --rebase origin main  # Fetch and rebase
git pull --ff-only origin main # Only fast-forward merges
```

### Practice task:
- Make changes on GitHub (add a file through the web interface)
- Pull those changes to your local repository
- Try different pull strategies

---

## Exercise 4: Fetch Updates (`git fetch`)

### What it does:
Downloads changes from the remote repository without merging them into your local branches.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. Fetch updates from remote:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. Fetch specific branch:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin feature-branch
   ```

3. Fetch all remotes:
   ```bash
   git fetch --all
   ```

### Expected output:
```
remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/username/repository-name
 * [new branch]      feature-branch -> origin/feature-branch
   a1b2c3d..e4f5g6h  main     -> origin/main
```

### Difference between fetch and pull:
- **Fetch**: Downloads changes but doesn't merge them
- **Pull**: Downloads changes AND merges them into current branch

### Practice task:
- Fetch updates from remote
- Check what new branches or commits are available
- Decide whether to merge or rebase the changes

## Exercise 5: View Remote Information (`git remote -v`)

### What it does:
Shows information about remote repositories connected to your local repository.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. View all remotes:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

2. View detailed remote information:
   ```bash
   git remote show origin
   ```

3. List remote branches:
   ```bash
   git branch -r
   ```

### Expected output:
```
origin  https://github.com/username/repository-name.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/username/repository-name.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/original/repository-name.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/original/repository-name.git (push)
```

### Useful remote commands:
```bash
git remote -v                    # List remotes with URLs
git remote show <name>           # Show detailed info
git remote add <name> <url>      # Add new remote
git remote remove <name>         # Remove remote
git remote rename <old> <new>    # Rename remote
```

### Practice task:
- Add multiple remotes (origin, upstream)
- View detailed information about each remote
- Understand the difference between fetch and push URLs

## Exercise 6: Remote Repository Workflow

### What it does:
Demonstrates a complete workflow for working with remote repositories in a collaborative environment.

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. Clone a repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```

3. Make changes and commit:
   ```bash
   echo "New feature content" > feature.txt
   git add feature.txt
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

4. Push feature branch to remote:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/new-feature
   ```

5. Switch back to main and pull latest changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

6. Merge feature branch:
   ```bash
   git merge feature/new-feature
   ```

7. Push merged changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Practice task:
- Follow the complete workflow above
- Create a pull request on GitHub
- Practice the fork-and-pull workflow

---

## Exercise 7: Working with Multiple Remotes

### What it does:
Shows how to work with multiple remote repositories (common in open source projects).

### Step-by-step instructions:
1. Add upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repository-name.git
   ```

2. Fetch from both remotes:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git fetch upstream
   ```

3. Merge upstream changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

4. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Practice task:
- Fork a repository on GitHub
- Add the original as upstream
- Keep your fork in sync with upstream
