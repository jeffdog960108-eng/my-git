## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Start with Week 5**: Begin with `05-git-history-debugging.md`
2. **Practice debugging**: Use real scenarios to practice debugging
3. **Experiment with features**: Try advanced features on test repositories
4. **Customize your workflow**: Set up configurations that work for you
5. **Apply to real projects**: Use these skills in your actual work

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Practice debugging**: Create intentional bugs to practice debugging techniques
- **Use real scenarios**: Apply these features to actual project situations
- **Experiment safely**: Use test repositories for trying new features
- **Read documentation**: Explore Git documentation for deeper understanding
- **Share knowledge**: Teach others what you learn

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Detached HEAD" state
**Solution**: Create a new branch or checkout an existing branch

### Issue: "Cannot reset" with uncommitted changes
**Solution**: Stash or commit your changes first

### Issue: "Cherry-pick conflict"
**Solution**: Resolve conflicts manually, then continue cherry-pick

### Issue: "Hook not executable"
**Solution**: Make hook files executable with `chmod +x`

## 🔄 Key Concepts

### History Management
- **Reset**: Moves branch pointer, rewrites history
- **Revert**: Creates new commit, preserves history
- **Bisect**: Binary search through history for bugs

### Advanced Features
- **Stash**: Temporary storage for uncommitted changes
- **Cherry-pick**: Selective application of commits
- **Tags**: Named references to specific commits
- **Hooks**: Automated scripts for Git events
