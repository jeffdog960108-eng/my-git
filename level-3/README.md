## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### ⚠️ Issue: "Detached HEAD" state
**Solution**: Create a new branch or checkout an existing branch

### ⚠️ Issue: "Cannot reset" with uncommitted changes
**Solution**: Stash or commit your changes first

### ⚠️ Issue: "Cherry-pick conflict"
**Solution**: Resolve conflicts manually, then continue cherry-pick

### ⚠️ Issue: "Hook not executable"
**Solution**: Make hook files executable with `chmod +x`

## 🔄 Key Concepts

### 📜 History Management
- **Reset**: Moves branch pointer, rewrites history
- **Revert**: Creates new commit, preserves history
- **Bisect**: Binary search through history for bugs

### ⚡ Advanced Features
- **Stash**: Temporary storage for uncommitted changes
- **Cherry-pick**: Selective application of commits
- **Tags**: Named references to specific commits
- **Hooks**: Automated scripts for Git events
